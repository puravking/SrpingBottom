# React Bottom Draggable Flam

## Introduction
Develop a React app that includes a bottom sheet with multiple snap points and smooth spring-based animations.
## Approach and Challenges:
Created a draggable bottom sheet in React involves setting up a component with a handle for dragging and a section for content. The position of the sheet is managed through React state, and mouse or touch events are used to update its vertical position based on Y-coordinates. Smooth transitions are achieved with CSS animations, while existing class styles are reused for consistent design.

Key challenges include accurately tracking the sheet's position during drag movements, integrating with current CSS styles, making the component responsive on different devices, handling browser inconsistencies, and ensuring accessibility for all users.
